    "  \n",
    "**THE DOCTOR**: Any number that reduces to one when you take the sum of the square of its digits and continue iterating it until it yields $1$ is a happy number. Any number that doesn’t, isn’t. A happy prime is both happy and prime.  \n",

    "## Input\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line of input contains a single integer $P, (1 \\leq P \\leq 10000)$, which is the number of data sets that follow. Each data set should be processed identically and independently.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Each data set consists of a single line of input. It contains the data set number, $K$, followed by the happy prime candidate, $m, (1 \\leq m \\leq 10000)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output\n",
    "For each data set there is a single line of output. The single output line consists of the data set number, $K$, followed by a single space followed by the candidate, $m$, followed by a single space, followed by `YES` or `NO`, indicating whether $m$ is a happy prime.\n",
