    "I am thinking of a number between $1$ and $1000$, can you guess what number it is? Given a guess, I will tell you whether the guess is too low, too high, or correct. But I will only give you $10$ guesses, so use them wisely!\n",

    "Your program should output guesses for the correct number, in the form of an integer between $1$ and $1000$ on a line on its own. After making each guess, you need to make sure to flush standard out.  \n",

    "After each guess, there will be a response to be read from standard in. This response is a line with one of the following three words:  \n",
